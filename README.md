4. This will populate the directory with a SchoolBoard folder.  Within this folder, open SchoolBoard.sln.

5.  Now run the application again using IIS Browser.  
 
  1. At the landing page, users are asked to login (or create new account).  
  
  2. As an example Instructor account, I have provided the following credentials: 
  UserName: "instructor@test.com"
  Password: "Test1!"
  Use these to login and demo the app.
  
  Example Admin Account Credentials are:
  Username: "admin@test.com"
  Password: "Test1!"
  
 
  
  3. Once Authenticated, instructors will be able to access list pages for the specific courses they are assigned, as well as a general list of all courses.
  There is also a search field for a site-global search.
  
  ![MyCourses](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58240410/117258637-2c914500-ae1b-11eb-9d76-44b0972c7733.PNG)
  
  4. Each of these Courses directs to a Student list view.
 
  5. Each Student list item is a clickable link which directs to the board for that student.  Here users can post messages and reply to existing messages.
